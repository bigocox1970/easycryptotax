REPORT STATUS: NO TAXABLE EVENTS
================================================================================

EXPLANATION:
No cryptocurrency disposals occurred in 2024 that would create taxable events.                                         
This is perfectly normal and compliant with UK tax requirements.                                                       

REASON ANALYSIS:
• Cryptocurrency purchases: 1 (Not taxable - builds cost basis for future sales)                                       
• Cryptocurrency sales/disposals: 0 (These would be taxable events)                                                    
• Fiat currency withdrawals: 2 (Not taxable - moving your own money)                                                   

UK TAX POSITION:
• Capital Gains Tax liability: £0.00 (No disposals occurred)                                                           
• Annual allowance used: £0 of £3,000 (£3,000 remaining)                                                              
• HMRC reporting requirement: No Self Assessment entry needed for this year                                            

COST BASIS BUILDING:
Your 1 purchase(s) establish cost basis for future tax calculations.                                                   
When you eventually sell these assets, gains/losses will be calculated from these purchase prices.
