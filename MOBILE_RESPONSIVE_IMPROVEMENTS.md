# Mobile Responsive Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Export Buttons Going Off Screen**
**Problem**: The two new export buttons were positioned horizontally and overflowed on mobile screens.

**Solution**: Implemented responsive layout with vertical stacking on mobile:
```tsx
// Before: Horizontal layout only
<div className="flex items-center space-x-4">

// After: Responsive layout
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-start sm:items-center space-y-3 sm:space-y-0 sm:space-x-4">
```

### 2. **Button Text Too Long on Mobile**
**Problem**: "Export Personal Report" and "Export for Accountant" were too long for mobile screens.

**Solution**: Added responsive text with shorter labels on mobile:
```tsx
<span className="hidden sm:inline">Export Personal Report</span>
<span className="sm:hidden">Personal Report</span>
```

### 3. **Full-Width Buttons on Mobile**
**Problem**: Buttons were too narrow on mobile making them hard to tap.

**Solution**: Made buttons full-width on mobile:
```tsx
className="flex-1 sm:flex-initial"  // Full width on mobile, auto on desktop
```

## Complete Responsive Layout

## Mobile UX Improvements

1. **Touch-Friendly**: All buttons are appropriately sized for mobile tapping
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Vertical layout on mobile maintains visual hierarchy
3. **Readable Text**: Shorter labels prevent text wrapping issues
4. **Full Utilization**: Components use full screen width on mobile
5. **No Horizontal Scroll**: All content fits within viewport width

## Testing Verified
